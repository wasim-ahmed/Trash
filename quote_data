Life doesn't come with instruction box that's why we have family. Since the inception of human beings one thing is for sure that humans are gregarious 
in nature, the sense of belongingness & connectedness is in our DNA that's why we are for our family. Amongst our family we share the special bond
with our siblings as that is a blood relation, there is nothing that needs to be said. We are there for each other in sickness & health and in 
good & bad times. It is a known fact that she was there to sacrifice herself when you needed her. Rarely people get a chance to help back.
It is not only your right but your responsibility to guide your sister when she need you the most. Otherwise if she take any decision inadvertently
then all will be left is regret & which will be irreversible. I believe your sister is calling for help out there all you need to do is to share your 
wisdom so that she don't take any wrong step. This is not about me it's for her, it is just i can't see even a drop of tear in her eye !
